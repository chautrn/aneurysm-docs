# Introduction

Whoever's reading this is probably a newcomer to the Rowan Aneurysm Project - so I'd like to say hi!
My name is Chau Tran and I worked on Dr. Hieu Nguyen and Dr. Yupeng Li's aneurysm research project throughout 
the summer and fall of 2021. If you ever have any questions/need help, feel free to contact me at tranch29@students.rowan.edu!

## Documentation Purpose

I hope that this documentation serves as a good way to introduce new members to my code if they ever need to use it.

Since it will be hosted on Github, it's also open-source! When you have a complicated code repo that needs
explaining to even newer members coming after you, I hope you'll find the time to add your own sections
to this website. Additionally, if you spot any mistakes in the documentation, feel free to commit changes and 
fix them. 

The end goal is to make onboarding easier and let future members be more productive faster as they join the
project.

## Tech Stack

Currently, we use [Python](https://www.python.org/) as our main programming language and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as our machine learning library.

If you are new to Python and/or PyTorch, it may help to kill two birds with one stone by completing some
[PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) relevant to the project.

Our research primarily deals with [convolutional neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhxdVk_sIs). It
would help to first get a basic mathematical understanding of convolutional neural networks and deep neural
networks in general.

### Other Libraries

Inevitably, you will have to deal with image processing - the novelty of the project depends on the
*process* in which we use machine learning.

The main image processing library we use is [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).
Knowing the ins-and-outs of the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library would also help, for which OpenCV and many
PyTorch repositories depend on.

In some image processing cases, [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) may also be helpful.
